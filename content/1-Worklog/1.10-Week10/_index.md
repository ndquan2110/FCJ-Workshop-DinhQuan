# Week 10 Worklog

## Week 10 Objectives

In week 10, the main goal was to explore the **cost optimization and system security** content group on AWS. This is part of the **Optimize / Optimizing system** group in the AWS Cloud Journey, focusing on security, reliability, performance, cost optimization, and system operations after deployment to AWS. ([Cloud Journey][1])

Key topics for the week include:

* Getting an overview of cost optimization on AWS.
* Exploring **AWS Budgets** to create budgets and cost alerts.
* Exploring **AWS Cost Explorer** to analyze service usage costs.
* Exploring **AWS KMS** to manage keys and encrypt data.
* Exploring **AWS WAF** to protect web applications and APIs.
* Exploring **AWS Security Hub** to check and assess security standards.
* Noting best practices for security and cost management on AWS.

## Week 10 Achievements

### Overview

This week, I explored services that support **cost optimization and strengthen system security on AWS**. The content has two main groups: cost management with **AWS Budgets** and **AWS Cost Explorer**, and security with **AWS KMS**, **AWS WAF**, and **AWS Security Hub**. AWS Budgets helps track costs and usage against budgets, while Cost Explorer helps view and analyze AWS usage costs. ([AWS Documentation][2])

### Knowledge gained

After completing week 10, I have understood:

* The role of cost optimization when deploying systems on AWS.
* How to use **AWS Budgets** to create budgets, set alert thresholds, and track usage costs.
* How to use **AWS Cost Explorer** to analyze cost by service, time, account, or tag.
* That **AWS KMS** is a key management and encryption service used to protect data in AWS services or in your own applications. ([AWS Documentation][3])
* That **AWS WAF** is a Web Application Firewall used to protect websites, APIs, and applications from bots, exploits, and application-layer attacks such as SQL Injection or Cross-site Scripting. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][4])
* That **AWS Security Hub** helps check security controls and create findings to assess compliance with security best practices. ([AWS Documentation][5])
* The importance of combining cost monitoring, sensible IAM permissions, data encryption, and WAF-based app protection.

## Practice

During the learning and exploration process, I was able to:

* Access AWS Billing and Cost Management on the AWS Console.
* Learn how to view AWS service usage costs.
* Learn how to create a budget to track monthly costs.
* Learn how to configure alerts when costs exceed a threshold.
* Learn how to view cost charts with Cost Explorer.
* Explore AWS KMS, Customer Managed Key, and AWS Managed Key.
* Learn how AWS KMS supports data encryption for services like S3, EBS, or RDS.
* Explore AWS WAF, Web ACL, Rule, and Managed Rule Group.
* Learn how AWS WAF can attach to CloudFront, Application Load Balancer, or API Gateway.
* Explore AWS Security Hub and the role of security findings in security assessment.
* Note common errors such as Cost Explorer not enabled, no budget created, missing IAM permissions, wrong WAF rule configuration, or encryption not enabled for important data.
